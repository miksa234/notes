Dear Milutin,

Thanks for the interest. Please find below some references. I'm also
happy to talk next week, feel free to drop by (I'm in the office in
front of ESI, write me an email before coming).

This <https://arxiv.org/abs/2011.12127> is a general review about
tensor networks (just in case). Maybe a good place to start to learn
about PEPS and the context in which it is used.In this paper
<https://arxiv.org/abs/1804.04964> we show how symmetries are reflected
in PEPS that describes systems without any topological order. This
paper is just a proof, and it is quite technical, so it won't help you
to understand the general concepts. If you like proofs though it might
be interesting.
Symmetries in PEPS are strongly linked to topological order. The
introduction part of these lecture notes
<https://arxiv.org/abs/1506.05805> might be useful to understand the
different kind of topological orders one might encounter.  That being
said,
This paper <https://arxiv.org/abs/1106.4752> is the first example how
to describe symmetry protected topological (SPT) order in PEPS.This
paper <https://arxiv.org/abs/1001.3807> shows how PEPS can describe
systems with topological order, for the simplest type of intrinsic
topological order. If you are not afraid to dive into category theory,
this paper <https://arxiv.org/abs/1410.4540> provides a classification
of topological phases with symmetry (symmetry enriched topological
phases, SET). This is not about PEPS, but the ideas behind are the same
anyway. In this paper <https://arxiv.org/abs/1711.07982> examples for
the above SET classification have been constructed using PEPS.
I think the last two papers are too hard/extensive for a seminar, but
it is nice to see where the theory can lead you. If you are interested
in topological order, then the G-injective paper
<https://arxiv.org/abs/1001.3807> might be the best to read from the
list above. As mentioned above, I am also happy to talk, maybe with a
personal meeting we can narrow down more what you actually are
interested in.

Best,
Andras
