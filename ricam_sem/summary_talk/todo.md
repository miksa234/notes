We need
    * more on coding
    * Tikhonov regularization
    * Space regularization
    * more on the decomposition cases
    * Proof of local convergence of GN
    * Proof of linear indepencdence thm
    * Proof of GN convergence with linear independence
    * Reproduction of numerical results of GN
    * Reproduction of numerical results of landweber
    * Reproduction of numerical results of circualr networks.
    * (reproduction or more in depth explanations)


Proving convergence:
    * prove Lipschitz-Differentiable immersion of shallow NNs
    * Linear independence of the activation function, first derivative and first
        moment of the first derrivaive
    * Newton Minkowski conditions for shallow NNs
    * Moore Penrose inverse
